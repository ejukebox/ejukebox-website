### What to hear it for yourself?

As an example, this is what eJukebox sounds like in real life. Go on, hook it up to some decent speakers/headphones, give it the pub test! Also request some songs to give it a real test [https://one.ejukebox.net](https://one.ejukebox.net)<br><br>

<!--Simplest syntax-->
<audio src="http://listen.ejukebox.net/one" type="audio/mpeg" controls>
  I'm sorry. You're browser doesn't support HTML5 <code>audio</code>.

Trouble with the embedded player? Take **eJukebox** wherever you go. Listen anywhere/anytime with the free iHeartRadio app, you can listen to us on [iHeart Radio](https://www.iheart.com/live/ejukebox-9243).
