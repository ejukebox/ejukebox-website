### What to hear it for yourself?

As an example, this is what eJukebox sounds like in real life. Go on, hook it up to some decent speakers/headphones, give it the pub test! Also request some songs to give it a real test [https://one.ejukebox.net](https://one.ejukebox.net)<br><br>

<!--Simplest syntax-->
