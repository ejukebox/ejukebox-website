## This was the brief for Bells Hotel

We were given the brief for music for Bells Hotel

| Data | Details |
|--------|--------|
| Venue | Bells Hotel |
| Identity | Country pub in the city, mix of locals, Navy personnel and diners from the finger wharf, only a beverage offering (no food), 150 pax, peak trade 3-8pm (Mon-Fri) |
|Style | Indie/alternative through to 60s, but similar style in all (think Dope Lemon through to Howlinâ€™ Wolf) |
| Clientele | Skews heavily male, predominantly consuming classic draught beer |

Nothing too out of the ordinary, however the right music playing is what activates the space and atmosphere (and spend) most directly.

We came up with approx. 1500 thousand songs sorted by popularity in descending order. We broke this list into chunks of 10, top 10, top 9, top 8 etc etc, then created a day-to-day playlist based on that.
