## The brief for Bells Hotel

We were given the brief for music for Bells Hotel:

| Data | Details |
|--------|--------|
| Venue | Bells Hotel |
| Identity | Country pub in the city, mix of locals, Navy personnel and diners from the finger wharf, only a beverage offering (no food), 150 pax, peak trade 3-8pm (Mon-Fri) |
|Style | Indie/alternative through to 60s, but similar style in all (think Dope Lemon through to Howlinâ€™ Wolf) |
| Clientele | Skews heavily male, predominantly consuming classic draught beer |

<br>

> Nothing too out of the ordinary, however the right music playing is what activates the space and atmosphere (and spend) most directly.

At eJukebox, we ran sixteen thousand of our songs through online global APIs to get back in return the most trusted and accurate metadata for our music. We overlaid the brief provided across the data set retrieved, and what came out the end of this was approximately one thousand five hundred songs.

From here, we didn't simply randomise the full list of 1500 songs. We went deeper than this. We tapped into the metadata sourced and used this analytics to not only match the brief, but also to sort the 1500 songs by **popularity** in descending order.

In addition to this, we added ratings to these songs to help in the final playlist creation. At **eJukebox**, we use professional radio station playlist scheduling software which gives us lots of functionality and advantages over others. We broke this descending list of 1500 songs by **popularity** into even sets of 10 - top 10 set, top 9 set, top 8 set etc etc, each of the 10 sets had their respective rating applied, e.g. the top 10 set of songs had a rating of 10, all the way down to the top 1 set which had rating of 1. We then created a day-to-day playlist spanning weeks using our software based on this rating information. 

The finished product, is where you will hear a top 1 set song more often than a top 2 set song, or you will hear a top 3 set song more often than a top 4 set song and so on and so forth. It gives the perception of a larger music library, where lower rating songs will be played not as often as the higher rated songs. This gives the impression of a much larger music library.

Don't just listen to a few songs, listen over a much larger period of time to really hear the difference of the song separation while adhering to the brief provided. 

## Other options

Now that we have this metadata, we can tweak/modify playlists fairly rapidly with high velocity. 

From the 1500 songs, we can dive deeper into this as per the the songs' finer metadata, either by scheduling based on time of day, or have **'mini'** child playlists with less songs, but more niche.

- We can split playlists up over various times of the day e.g. more laid back during the day and a bit more liveliness at the tail end of the day
- We can have multiple playlists by carving up the 1500 songs even further into much finer playlists, some songs with a more **rock** feeling Vs a **dance** feeling played at various times or in their own respective **'mini'** playlist. 
- We can also based on the age of the song, have songs from the 60s/70s/80s played across various times or in their own **'mini'** playlist as well. 

We have many options to work with here to adjust as necessary.

## The song list

Here is the complete song list in a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/39yhEP540n4DbbubGcdR6n). While this is great to see all the songs at once, all songs on Spotify are treated equal and it doesn't reflect each songs popularity over the next song.

The below is the current playlist in descending order of highest popularity song to the lowest popularity song. When played on **eJukebox**, the playlist is more intelligent and will adhere song metadata. The higher the popularity of the song, these will be played more often than songs lower in priority.
