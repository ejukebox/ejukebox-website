## Hear what it sounds like at Bells Hotel?

As an example, this is what eJukebox could sond like at Bells Hotel. Go on, hook it up to some decent speakers/headphones, give it the pub test! 

<!--Simplest syntax-->
<audio src="http://listen.ejukebox.net/demo" type="audio/mpeg" controls>
  I'm sorry. You're browser doesn't support HTML5 <code>audio</code>.
</audio>

Still having trouble, or if you manually want to add this to a custom app or Sonos for example? Here's a direct link to the stream: [Listen Live](http://listen.ejukebox.net/demo).
