**eJukebox** is fully controlled by a smartphone app that can replace a DJ on most occasions. Lets face it, a normal DJ just stands in the corner and presses buttons mostly playing what they think the crowd wants to hear. Instead, your customers will be happy customers where they themselves can be the DJ choosing songs on their smartphone with the guardrails in place that you setup, so that a heavy metal song won't play while people are dining for example. The **eJukebox** music solution is available for functions or is available as a permanent music solution. We are a popular music provider and an obvious choice for venues such as pubs, clubs, bars, cafes or retail outlets.
