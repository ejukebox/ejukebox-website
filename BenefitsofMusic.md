## Benefits of music


### Music makes wine taste better
When 250 British students were split into four groups and offered the same glass of wine while listening to a different song, they overwhelmingly said the wine tasted similar to the personality of the music they were listening to even though every glass poured was the same.

### Music encourages beer sales
The patrons were exposed to either the usual volume or a high volume of background music. The results show that high volume levels led to increased alcohol consumption and reduced the average amount of time to drink their glass of beer.

### Music Keeps Your Customers Inside for Longer!
In one eight-week study once the food was served to customers given the slow-music treatment (that is, under 72 Beats Per Minute) they took 11 minutes more to complete their dinners and leave (56 minutes) than those given the fast-music treatment (92 Beats Per Minute or more) (who left at the 45 minute mark).

### Playing Music Can Help You Sell More
In one study, under a slow music treatment (that is, under 72 Beats Per Minute) the average dollar amount spent on food per customer group in one study was $55.81 compared with an average of $55.12 under the fast-music treatment (92 Beats Per Minute or more), not really a huge difference.

However, when the expenditures for alcoholic beverages were analysed, the findings were quite different. Slow music listeners had an average bar charge (per customer group) of $30.47 compared with $21.62 for those under the fast music treatment. That represented an average of 3.04 more drinks per customer group. [More details](https://onemusic.com.au/news/2018/july/encourage-your-customers-to-make-an-extra-purchase/)
