We may be categorised as a [background](https://backgroundmusicguide.com.au/) music provider, but we act as if we're a **foreground** music provider for pubs, clubs, bars, venues, cafes or retail outlets.

## How are we different?
The founders of eJukebox are not focused first and foremost by running a business and simply just making a profit. eJukebox music for businesses is our passion and we live and breath it every single song that is played across all playlists.

- We come from a commercial radio background with formal training by industry experts. This means that we are best for music scheduling, we know what works and what doesn't, we know what people want to hear and understand the psychology behind it.

- We have also worked for Microsoft in highly technical roles, this means that we really understand technology better than the rest

Our solution may be cheaper than the others, however we don't sacrifice on quality. As we have expertly designed and crafted our solution in the cloud, we can ensure that we get the [best value for money](http://aka.ms/waf/cost) and [reliability](http://aka.ms/waf/reliability), while at the same time ensuring that we pass on this value on to our customers.

- More music available compared to others
- Intelligent music scheduling with songs on different rotations to other songs
- Artist and song separation to ensure that you don't hear the same song twice in a row
- Renowned as a pioneer in the realm of remarkable audio quality as outlined [here](https://hdradio.au)

## Spotify
Everyone often assumes that they can simply play **Spotify** at their venue, such as pubs, clubs, cafes or retail. While this can be significantly cheaper, this is strictly prohibited as per [https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-public-commercial-use](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-public-commercial-use). If you think about it, **Spotify** is **one to one**, meaning each individual pays for the legal right to listen to the music (themselves). In a pub, there's numerous other people who also listen to the music, and it's these extra people that are not allowed to have a free ride off the individual who owns the **Spotify** subscription. This is the reason that **eJukebox** can be slightly more expensive when compared to a **Spotify** subscription, as **eJukebox** is **one to many**. 

With that in mind, based on an average cost of a **Spotify** subscription in comparison to **eJukebox**, you'd be breaking even at about 15 pax at your venue, then any number above this you'd be well & truly in front.
