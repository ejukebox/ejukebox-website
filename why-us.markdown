## Spotify
Everyone often assumes that they can simply play **Spotify** at their venue, such as pubs, clubs, cafes or retail. While this can be significantly cheaper, this is strictly prohibited as per [https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-public-commercial-use](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-public-commercial-use). If you think about it, **Spotify** is **one to one**, meaning each individual pays for the legal right to listen to the music (themselves). In a pub, there's numerous other people who also listen to the music, and it's these extra people that are not allowed to have a free ride off the individual who owns the **Spotify** subscription. This is the reason that **eJukebox** can be slightly more expensive when compared to a **Spotify** subscription, as **eJukebox** is **one to many**. 

With that in mind, based on an average cost of a **Spotify** subscription in comparison to **eJukebox**, you'd be breaking even at about 15 pax at your venue, then any number above this you'd be well & truly in front.
