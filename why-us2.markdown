### What sets eJukebox apart from the others as the music solution for pubs, clubs, cafes and retail outlets?
At **eJukebox**, it's in our DNA that we think outside of the box. It's the smaller things that set us in front of the others. It's our attention to detail. 

What sets us apart of the others?

### Music is sped up by 3%
Not my much, but music on **eJukebox** is sped up by about 3 percent. At this small percentage, your customers won't notice this **consciously**, but it's enough that they will notice this **subconsciously**. This same subtle trick is used by radio stations around the globe to influence listeners choice of their favourite radio station. This trick is also used by some live DJs. If done properly, music that is sped up at a faster pace portrays the perception of energy and excitement. This is super powerful, as when **subconsciously energized**, your customers will be more exhilarated, engaged and activated. 

According to [research](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-subconscious-mind-of-the-consumer-and-how-to-reach-it) by Harvard Business School professor Gerald Zaltman, up to 95% of our [purchase decisions](https://cxl.com/blog/9-things-to-know-about-influencing-purchasing-decisions/) are directed by subconscious mental processes

Using subconscious influences is an extremely powerful sales tool which will drive your customers to spend more money.

### We do not alienate your customers
Songs played on **eJukebox** are familiar to your customers. Based on findings from our existing customers, we find that patrons are normally relaxed and complaisant in the first 30 minutes of being at a venue that plays music which they can relate to. Music that is familiar to your customers, makes them feel warm and grounded. This then creates stickiness, it means your customers stay longer and end up spending more money. 

It's commercial radio's business to attract listeners to their stations. This is how they make money, so it's fundamental that they play the right kind of music so suit their target demographic. At **eJukebox**, we capture each and every song that commercial radio stations play, how many times a particular song is played and when exactly the song is played. We take this data and use it to create our playlists. 

**Kyle Sandilands** is highest paid media personality in Australia, he attracts listeners to **Kiis FM** Sydney. Being the number one FM radio station in Sydney, **Kiis FM** listeners are all too familiar with music on **Kiis FM**. With **eJukebox**, our **CHR/Pop** playlist is a direct match to that of Kiis FM. As an example, if an **Ed Sheeran** song is played 100 times in a week on Kiis FM in comparison to a **Dua Lipa** song was played 50 times in this same week, with **eJukebox** you'd hear exactly the same rotation of songs. So you can say that with the **Top 40/Pop** playlist we sound exactly like **Kiis FM**, without the commercials and talking. 

### Quality of music
The quality of music is everything. Customers expect to hear their favourite songs in all it's glory. **eJukebox** is renowned for having the best audio quality. All songs are played at exactly the same volume accommodating for high and low inflictions in the song, but it doesn't stop there. At eJukebox, we use audio AGCs (automatic gain controls) and limiters, similar to that of FM radio stations. 

There's a couple of different type of limiters, single-band limiter and or wide-band / multi-band limiters. At **eJukebox** we use multi-band limiters. The big difference is that multi-band limiters processes the entire frequency spectrum, not just a single frequency. The result is a more natural and authentic volume normalisation output which can withstand loud bass lines in songs. Whereas with single-band limiters, when heavy bass is played in the songs, single-band limiters have trouble separating this bass from the other frequencies, the bass is perceived at a very high volume and as a result the single-band limiter incorrectly turns down the overall volume of the song.
