## What is **eJukebox**?

<img align="left" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:10px 10px 10px 0px" width="225" src="blobs/what_is_ejukebox.jpg">

**eJukebox** is a technically advanced jukebox that accepts requests from a mobile phone and also plays music 24/7 throughout the entirety of a venue where it is setup. It can plug into any existing sound system and can easily extend to cover any size venue.<br><br>**eJukebox** is a jukebox that is controlled by a smartphone which replaces a DJ on most occasions. Lets face it, a normal DJ just stands in the corner and presses buttons mostly playing what they've been told to from the person that hired them. Instead, everyone can be the DJ choosing their own songs on their smartphone where ever they are without the need to stand in front of an actual jukebox. **eJukebox** is available for functions or is available as a permanent music solution. We are a popular music provider and an obvious choice for venues such as pubs, clubs, cafes or retail.

The **eJukebox** music system has arguably the largest collection of popular music with all the newest music. We have a full music library with all the latest music thanks to our licenses which provide you with regular new music releases from all the major record companies.  

### At the pub, behind the scenes
This is what **eJukebox** looks like installed at the venue. **eJukebox** is zero touch, they are nested away in the backend never to be seen by anyone. **eJukebox** is cloud connected, fully managed with realtime automatic updates to music. 

Below is an actual **eJukebox** installation at one of our larger customers, two jukebox systems (one for each zone). Maybe small, but these little devices are state of the art running the latest **Windows 10** OS. As for the reliability aspect, these little **Intel** compute sticks have been installed since 2018 and haven't had any issues at all. Reliability is due the solid state nature of the device with an Intel chipset. Less moving parts means less can go wrong and maintenance is reduced to virtually nothing. The hard drive is solid state, there's a local solid state cache and with cloud connectivity. As these systems are zero touch, they update by themselves from the cloud.
- State of the art USB audio adapter which plugs directly into the existing audio system
- USB ethernet adaptor for wired ethernet, as WiFi is horrendously unreliable
- State of the art audio processing for unbeatable sound quality

If the internet drops out, no problems, customers notice nothing. These devices carry a backup music library and can keep playing for an infinite period of time until which time the internet comes back up again.

The best part about these little devices, they are massively cost effective and significantly cheaper to run and to sign up to. With a much lower foot print, fully managed and automated, we pass these savings on to you.

</p>

**eJukebox** is new and hip. While all other music solutions are all static, eJukebox is the only totally automated shared music solution which is totally dynamic. **eJukebox** is exactly like a conventional jukebox, except much newer - conventional jukeboxes are old school. An old school jukebox is a static device that sits on a wall or in the corner of a room, whereas **eJukebox** is today's technology in a jukebox eliminating the need to be anti-social lining up or standing in front of a jukebox for ages browsing through songs. There are many other leading features that make our jukeboxes better than a standard jukebox, the biggest difference is that our jukebox is totally controlled by a smartphone from practically anywhere the music is heard.

**Who needs a DJ, when everyone can be the DJ**. With an **eJukebox** system, all your customers become the DJ, they can browse through all the music available on eJukebox conveniently from their smartphone, then they can choose a song straight away at the same time while holding a drink in the other hand. Customers can see what songs have been requested by everyone and see when their song is coming up. 

As **eJukebox** is interactive, it will bring people closer together in an environment where they can interact with one another with excitement. Background music won't remain background music any longer, it will become the focus of the venue and spark that party atmosphere that will effortlessly drive those repeatable drink sales that you've been looking for.

</p>

- The quality of our audio is second to none. We use similar audio processing to that of radio stations. All music is processed in real-time using a Multiband Automatic Gain Control (AGC) Limiter<br><br>
- All songs played with eJukebox are perfectly mixed with one another<br><br>

- eJukebox uses music automation software just like radio stations allowing all songs to be intelligently mixed. No matter if a song ends cold or fades out gradually, the finished product that you hear through the speakers will make you think a DJ has mixed it professionally


### Why us?
Everyone often assumes that they can simply play **Spotify** at their venue, such as pubs, clubs, cafes or retail. While this can be significantly cheaper, this is strictly prohibited as per [https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-public-commercial-use](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-public-commercial-use). If you think about it, **Spotify** is **one to one**, meaning each individual pays for the legal right to listen to the music (themselves). In a pub, there's numerous other people who also listen to the music, and it's these extra people that are not allowed to have a free ride off the individual who owns the **Spotify** subscription. This is the reason that **eJukebox** can be slightly more expensive when compared to a **Spotify** subscription, as **eJukebox** is **one to many**. 

With that in mind, based on an average cost of a **Spotify** subscription in comparison to **eJukebox**, you'd be breaking even at about 15 pax at your venue, then any number of this you'd be well & truly in front.
